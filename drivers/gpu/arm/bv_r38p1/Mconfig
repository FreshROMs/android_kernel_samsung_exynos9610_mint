menuconfig MALI_MIDGARD
	bool "Mali Midgard series support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option to build support for a ARM Mali Midgard GPU.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  this will generate a single module, called mali_kbase.

config MALI_PLATFORM_NAME
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
	string "Platform name"
	default "hisilicon" if PLATFORM_HIKEY960
	default "hisilicon" if PLATFORM_HIKEY970
	default "devicetree"
	help
	  Enter the name of the desired platform configuration directory to
	  include in the build. 'platform/$(MALI_PLATFORM_NAME)/Kbuild' must
	  exist.

	  When PLATFORM_CUSTOM is set, this needs to be set manually to
	  pick up the desired platform files.

	  Enables support for CSF based GPUs.

config MALI_DEVFREQ
	bool "Enable devfreq support for Mali"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
	default y
	help
	  Support devfreq for Mali.

	  Using the devfreq framework and, by default, the simple on-demand
	  governor, the frequency of Mali will be dynamically selected from the
	  available OPPs.

config MALI_MIDGARD_DVFS
	bool "Enable legacy DVFS"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && !MALI_DEVFREQ
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable legacy DVFS in the Mali Midgard DDK.

config MALI_GATOR_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable Streamline tracing support"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && !BACKEND_USER
	default y
	help
	  Enables kbase tracing used by the Arm Streamline Performance Analyzer.
	  The tracepoints are used to derive GPU activity charts in Streamline.

config MALI_MIDGARD_ENABLE_TRACE
	bool "Enable kbase tracing"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
	default y if MALI_DEBUG
	default n
	help
	  Enables tracing in kbase. Trace log available through
	  the "mali_trace" debugfs file, when the CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is enabled

config MALI_DMA_FENCE
	bool "Enable DMA_BUF fence support for Mali"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
	default n
	help
	  Support DMA_BUF fences for Mali.

	  This option should only be enabled if the Linux Kernel has built in
	  support for DMA_BUF fences.

config MALI_ARBITER_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable arbiter support for Mali"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && !MALI_CSF_SUPPORT
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for the arbiter interface in the driver.
	  This allows an external arbiter to manage driver access
	  to GPU hardware in a virtualized environment

	  If unsure, say N.

config DMA_BUF_SYNC_IOCTL_SUPPORTED
	bool "Enable Kernel DMA buffers support DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC"

	bool "Enable map imported dma-bufs on demand"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
	default n
	default y if !DMA_BUF_SYNC_IOCTL_SUPPORTED
	help
	  This option caused kbase to set up the GPU mapping of imported
	  dma-buf when needed to run atoms. This is the legacy behavior.

	  This is intended for testing and the option will get removed in the
	  future.

config MALI_DMA_BUF_LEGACY_COMPAT
	bool "Enable legacy compatibility cache flush on dma-buf map"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && !MALI_DMA_BUF_MAP_ON_DEMAND
	default n
	help
	  This option enables compatibility with legacy dma-buf mapping
	  behavior, then the dma-buf is mapped on import, by adding cache
	  maintenance where MALI_DMA_BUF_MAP_ON_DEMAND would do the mapping,
	  including a cache flush.

	  This option might work-around issues related to missing cache
	  flushes in other drivers. This only has an effect for clients using
	  UK 11.18 or older. For later UK versions it is not possible.

menuconfig MALI_EXPERT
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
	bool "Enable Expert Settings"
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this option and modifying the default settings may produce
	  a driver with performance or other limitations.

config MALI_2MB_ALLOC
	bool "Attempt to allocate 2MB pages"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  Rather than allocating all GPU memory page-by-page, attempt to
	  allocate 2MB pages from the kernel. This reduces TLB pressure and
	  helps to prevent memory fragmentation.

	  If in doubt, say N

config MALI_MEMORY_FULLY_BACKED
	bool "Enable memory fully physically-backed"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  This option enables full physical backing of all virtual
	  memory allocations in the kernel. Notice that this build
	  option only affects allocations of grow-on-GPU-page-fault
	  memory.

config MALI_CORESTACK
	bool "Enable support of GPU core stack power control"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this feature on supported GPUs will let the driver powering
	  on/off the GPU core stack independently without involving the Power
	  Domain Controller. This should only be enabled on platforms which
	  integration of the PDC to the Mali GPU is known to be problematic.
	  This feature is currently only supported on t-Six and t-HEx GPUs.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MALI_FW_CORE_DUMP
	bool "Enable support for FW core dump"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT && MALI_CSF_SUPPORT
	default n
	help
	  Adds ability to request firmware core dump

	  Example:
	  * To explicitly request core dump:
		echo 1 >/sys/kernel/debug/mali0/fw_core_dump
	  * To output current core dump (after explicitly requesting a core dump,
	    or kernel driver reported an internal firmware error):
                cat /sys/kernel/debug/mali0/fw_core_dump

choice

	  Error injection is disabled.

config MALI_ERROR_INJECT_TRACK_LIST

	  Errors to inject are pre-configured by the user.

config MALI_ERROR_INJECT_RANDOM

	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT && NO_MALI
	help
	  Injected errors are random, rather than user-driven.

config MALI_FENCE_DEBUG

	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
	default y if MALI_DEBUG
	help
	  Select this option to enable additional checking and reporting on the
	  use of sync fences in the Mali driver.

	  This will add a 3s timeout to all sync fence waits in the Mali
	  driver, so that when work for Mali has been waiting on a sync fence
	  for a long time a debug message will be printed, detailing what fence
	  is causing the block, and which dependent Mali atoms are blocked as a
	  result of this.

	  The timeout can be changed at runtime through the js_soft_timeout
	  device attribute, where the timeout is specified in milliseconds.

config MALI_SYSTEM_TRACE
	bool "Enable system event tracing support"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
	default y if MALI_DEBUG
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable system trace events for each

	  minimal overhead when not in use. Enable only if you know what
	  you are doing.

# Instrumentation options.

	help
	  PWRSOFT-765 fixes devfreq cooling devices issues. The fix was merged
	  in kernel v4.10, however if backported into the kernel then this
	  option must be manually selected.

	  If using kernel >= v4.10 then say N, otherwise if devfreq cooling
	  changes have been backported say Y to avoid compilation errors.

	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
	default n
	default y if PLATFORM_JUNO
	help
	  This option disables the default workaround for GPU2017-1336. The
	  workaround keeps the L2 cache powered up except for powerdown and reset.

	  The workaround introduces a limitation that will prevent the running of
	  protected mode content on fully coherent platforms, as the switch to IO
	  coherency mode requires the L2 to be turned off.

	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT && !MALI_HW_ERRATA_1485982_NOT_AFFECTED

	help
	  This option uses an alternative workaround for GPU2017-1336. Lowering
	  the GPU clock to a, platform specific, known good frequeuncy before
	  powering down the L2 cache. The clock can be specified in the device
	  tree using the property, opp-mali-errata-1485982. Otherwise the
	  slowest clock will be selected.

config SCSI_UFSHCD
	tristate "Universal Flash Storage Controller Driver Core"
	depends on SCSI && SCSI_DMA
	select NLS
	---help---
	This selects the support for UFS devices in Linux, say Y and make
	  sure that you know the name of your UFS host adapter (the card
	  inside your computer that "speaks" the UFS protocol, also
	  called UFS Host Controller), because you will be asked for it.
	  The module will be called ufshcd.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/ufs.txt>.
	  However, do not compile this as a module if your root file system
	  (the one containing the directory /) is located on a UFS device.

config UFS_UN_18DIGITS
	bool "The digits of SEC unique number"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PCI
	tristate "PCI bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && PCI
	---help---
	This selects the PCI UFS Host Controller Interface. Select this if
	you have UFS Host Controller with PCI Interface.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_DWC_TC_PCI
	tristate "DesignWare pci support using a G210 Test Chip"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD_PCI
	---help---
	  Synopsys Test Chip is a PHY for prototyping purposes.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	tristate "Platform bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD
	---help---
	This selects the UFS host controller support. Select this if
	you have an UFS controller on Platform bus.

	If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_DWC_TC_PLATFORM
	tristate "DesignWare platform support using a G210 Test Chip"

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_ASYNC_RELINK
	tristate "Asynchronous link establishment on UFS device resume"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	---help---
	  This feature is to support concurrency of UFS resume and the others.
	  In UFS re-link, system wake-up may task a long time when UFS resume
	  time is increased for device latency or etc.

	  If you want to enable this feature, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_CMD_LOGGING
	tristate "UFS cmd loggging support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	---help---
	  This feature is to support UFS cmd logging.
	  When UFS cmd transferred to UFS HCI
	  various data logs for debugging purpose.

	  If you want to enable this feature, say Y or M here.

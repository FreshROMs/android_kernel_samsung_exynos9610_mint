### 📲 Release Guide

Beta releases of Mint Kernel use the following file name template:

`MintBeta-(Mint Build).(Android Version).(Variant)_A50.CI.zip`

1. Please select the appropriate variant of the kernel for the ROM you're currently using.
2. Mint recommends installing **Enforcing builds** unless Permissive kernels are **necessary to boot your ROM.**
3. Use AOSP builds **only** on non-One UI ROMs as these have some features from One UI disabled.

For selecting the variant, if you are using:

 - Fresh or any One UI ROM, select **"OneUI"** builds for your Android version
 - LineageOS or AOSP-based ROMs, select **"AOSP"** builds for your Android version

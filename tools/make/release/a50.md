## Mint 11.3.1 - Samsung Galaxy A50

### Changelog

- Upstream kernel to `Linux 4.14.180`
- A complete rework of Fresh Core from scratch, improving kernel memory management.
- Add Samsung SQZR/RAM Plus support for ZRAM writeback. Requires system changes.
- Change default I/O scheduler to `maple` since we need good performance for writeback now.
- Boosted fingerprint scan to improve biometric speed.
- SPARSEMEM is back, since I observed that RAM usage is slightly lower when it's used.
- Move back to 300HZ interrupts to slightly improve device performance.
- For-performance tweaks from custom kernels for the Pixel 4, OnePlus 6, POCO X3, and Redmi Note 9S.
- Merge remaining tweaks from Fresh Core. Barring select features currently in private testing, Mint builds are now about 100% as feature-rich as older builds.
